# Earth Day Tree ID @ Shively Park
Monday, April 22 from 11 am - 12:30 pm
## General Structure of the Program
This will be a program primarily targeted at novice tree IDers. If they have some experience or knowledge, that's great!
Regardless, there should still be a lot to learn for anyone in attendance.

There will be two distinct phases of the program:
1. *The explanatory phase:* This is where I will present some of the key heuristics and dichotomous keys for quick tree ID
   of common trees in the area: WHALE, MADBuck, Red vs White Oak, and differences in Conifers. I will have a pre-perscribed
   path that I will take through the park that will give us the opportunity to talk about everything
2. *The exploratory phase:* After I have imparted my wisdom on the patrons, I will then send them on a scavenger hunt, where
   they will be required to find a tree in the park that fits the requirement I've provided (ex. Find me a Conifer and tell me
   what kind of tree you think it is. Something red - a tree with red in its common name. So on and so forth)

In order for this program to succeed I will need to provide materials for patrons, and this will be the goal of the reference 
materials that I will provide for them.

## Preparation To-Do List
- [ ] Email Sarah to let her know that I need to work in the morning on April 22nd.
- [ ] Walk the park to get a feel for the trees that are there
- [ ] Chart a path through the park for the first half of the program
- [ ] Type up a short reference book to give to patrons:
- *MADBuck* - Maple, Ash, Dogwood, Buckeye (refers to common trees in the area that have opposite leaf arrangement)
- *WHALE* - Walnut, Hickory, Ash, Locust, Elder (refers to common trees that have complex leaves)
- Red vs White Maple ID tactics
- Distinguishing Conifers (They aren't all pine trees)
- Hall of Fame of identifiable buds, flowers, leaves, and bark for trees that don't fit into the other camps above
- [ ] Place books on hold for patrons to check out if they find the program and process of Tree ID interesting
